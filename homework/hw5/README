This program creates, and does one out of four possible operations on, a list of the frequencies of every trigram (group of three words) in the textfiles specified in the input filename list.

The operations are a (outputs trigram list in ascending alphabetical order by trigram), d (outputs trigram list in descending alphabetical order by trigram) c (outputs trigram list in decreasing order of frequency), and f (outputs most frequently occcuring third word given the first two).

To run the program, type:
./hw5 input_filename.txt operation extra_arguments

Valid arguments for operation are a, d, c, and f.
Extra-arguments are only necessary for the 'f' operation (must supply first and second words)
